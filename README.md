# Rule-Based Chatbot
This project is a simple yet elegant rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It is built using Python's Tkinter library for the user interface, and it utilizes basic if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.



# Features
Rule-Based Responses: The chatbot uses predefined rules to generate responses to user inputs.
Modern UI Design: The interface is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, using Tkinter.
Keyboard Interaction: Users can press "Enter" to send messages, making the chatbot more intuitive to use.
